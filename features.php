        <h2>Travel Tips for a Smooth Journey</h2>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Pack Light</h3>
            <p>One of the best travel tips is to pack light. Avoid overpacking by choosing versatile clothing and packing only the essentials. Remember, most airlines have strict baggage limits, and you don't want to waste time lugging around heavy suitcases. Opt for items that you can mix and match to create different outfits, and leave some room in your luggage for souvenirs!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Book Flights Early</h3>
            <p>Booking your flights in advance can help you secure the best rates and avoid last-minute price hikes. Use flight comparison websites to monitor prices and find the best deals. Don’t forget to consider factors like baggage fees and seat selection costs when comparing airlines!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Learn Basic Local Phrases</h3>
            <p>While English is widely spoken in many countries, learning a few basic phrases in the local language can go a long way in helping you connect with locals. Simple greetings like "hello," "thank you," and "please" can make your interactions more friendly and respectful.</p>
